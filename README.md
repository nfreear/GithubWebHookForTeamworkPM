# A Github Webhook for TeamworkPM

To use, clone to a Web server. Then:

1. Copy `config.TEMPLATE.php` to `config.php`
2. In `config.php`, change user token to the user's token that will post on Github's behalf.
3. Change the URL to your TeamworkPM's url (including the resource you'd like
   the commits to post to, e.g. `/task/`) and you're ready to go.
4. In the `Settings > Web hooks` page for your project on GitHub, choose `Add webhook`.
5. Set `Content type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Leave `Secret` blank.

When committing to Github you can reference a [TeamworkPM][] task via it's ID with `#`.
E.g. `"Fixes #123456"` where `#123456` is the TeamworkPM Task ID (or as the [API][]
calls it, the Teamwork Resource ID â€” https://yoursite.eu.teamwork.com/tasks/123456).
